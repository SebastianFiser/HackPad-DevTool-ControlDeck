# Modes

## Overview
The deck operates in three distinct modes. Each mode provides a contextual layout for the buttons, encoders, and LEDs. The active mode and corresponding mappings are displayed on the OLED display to minimize cognitive load. Modes are designed to group functions by workflow, allowing efficient access to system commands and actions.

## 1. Development Mode (DEV)

**Purpose:** Accelerate programming and development workflows.

**Primary Functions:**
- **Launch Applications:** Quickly start development tools and browsers.
- **System Recovery / Panic:** Terminate non-responsive applications or restart the desktop shell to recover from freezes.
- **Save / Commit Actions:** Provide one-touch save, smart save, or version control shortcuts.
- **Window Management:** Switch between active windows or workspaces.

**Encoder Roles:**
- Adjust system volume
- Navigate timeline / scroll within active applications

**LED Feedback:**
- Indicate active applications
- Signal system busy or error states

## 2. Control / Manipulation Mode (CTRL)

**Purpose:** Manage system parameters and hardware settings.

**Primary Functions:**
- Adjust brightness
- Adjust audio volume
- Toggle Bluetooth
- Toggle WiFi

**Encoder Roles:**
- Fine-grained control of brightness
- Fine-grained control of audio volume
- Optional gesture input via accelerometer (e.g., tilt to mute)

**LED Feedback:**
- Show on/off status of Bluetooth and WiFi
- Indicate current brightness and volume levels

## 3. Vibe / Custom Mode (VIBE)

**Purpose:** Flexible, user-defined workflow macros and hotkeys.

**Primary Functions:**
- Map user-defined hotkeys for frequently used applications
- Execute custom macros or sequences
- Integrate with multimedia or stream controls

**Encoder Roles:**
- Customizable mapping per user preference
- Navigation within macro menus or adjustable parameters

**LED Feedback:**
- Show active macro or hotkey state
- Indicate mode-specific status

## Mode Switching

- A dedicated key or combination switches between modes.
- The OLED display always shows the active mode and a summary of key functions.
- RGB LEDs provide additional visual feedback, including mode identification and system status.
